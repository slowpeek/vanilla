* About

This script can be used to install and keep updated the official linux
builds of [[https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/firefox/releases/][Firefox]] and [[https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/thunderbird/releases/][Thunderbird]]. Regular releases, betas and ESR
(Firefox only) are supported.

As of time of writing, the builds [[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/91.0/system-requirements/][require]] =glibc 2.17=. It means for
example Ubuntu 14.04 is the oldest supported Ubuntu and Debian 8 is
the oldest supported Debian. With that limitation in mind the script
requires at least =bash 4.3=

* Installation

The only required step is creating the [[#base-dir][base dir]].

Some [[#commands][commands]] rely on external tools which are not always available by
default. Here is the complete list with package names for Ubuntu:

- curl (from =curl=)
- gpg (from =gnupg=)
- column (from =bsdmainutils=)
- xz (from =xz-utils=)

You can use the [[#desktop][desktop]] command to generate sample desktop files.

You might also want to symlink the installed binaries under some dir
from =$PATH= like =~/.local/bin=, =/usr/local/bin= or even
=/usr/bin=. For example:

#+begin_example
  /usr/local/bin/firefox-esr => /opt/mozilla/firefox-esr/firefox
  /usr/local/bin/thunderbird => /opt/mozilla/thunderbird/thunderbird
#+end_example

** Firejail notes

Put the symlinks into =/usr/bin= and symlink those to the [[https://github.com/netblue30/firejail][Firejail]]
binary under =/usr/local/bin=. For example:

#+begin_example
  /usr/bin/firefox-esr => /opt/mozilla/firefox-esr/firefox
  /usr/bin/thunderbird => /opt/mozilla/thunderbird/thunderbird

  /usr/local/bin/firefox-esr => /usr/bin/firejail
  /usr/local/bin/thunderbird => /usr/bin/firejail
#+end_example

Firejail has stock profiles for the binaries with =-beta= and =-esr=
suffixes, so it works out of the box that way.

Currently (as of 0.9.66) the thunderbird-beta profile declares
=private-opt thunderbird-beta=. So by default it would not work with
installations anywhere under =/opt= but =/opt/thunderbird-beta=. To
make it work with installations somewhere else under =/opt=, use such
override:

#+begin_example
  # /etc/firejail/thunderbird-beta.local

  ignore private-opt
#+end_example

** Packages

- firefox
- firefox-beta
- firefox-esr
- thunderbird
- thunderbird-beta

** Base dir

The script installs packages into the /base dir/, by default
=/opt/mozilla=. With =-b <dir>= / =--base <dir>= you can set a custom
base dir.

*The script doesnt create the base dir*, you should create it yourself.

With some packages installed, the base dir layout looks like this:

#+begin_example
  firefox -> firefox-91.0
  firefox-78.12.0esr
  firefox-90.0.1
  firefox-90.0.2
  firefox-91.0
  firefox-91.0esr
  firefox-esr -> firefox-91.0esr
  thunderbird-91.0b6
  thunderbird-beta -> thunderbird-91.0b6
#+end_example

As you see there are multiple versions of some packages and some of
those are targeted by non-versioned symlinks. You can interactively
retarget the symlinks with the [[#select][select]] command.

The script doesnt remove anything from the base dir if not asked
for. You might want to uninstall outdated versions from time to time
with the [[#delete][delete]] or [[#prune][prune]] commands.

** Languages

Mozilla provides packages in many languages. By default the script
uses =en-US= one. You can set a custom lang with =-l <lang>= / =--lang
<lang>=. Use the [[#langs][langs]] command to list available languages for a
package.

** FZF picker

By default the interactive picker uses =fzf= if available and version
=0.20= at least. You can force it off with =--no-fzf=.

In case =fzf= is older than =0.20=, the picker doesnt use =fzf= by
default but you can force it to with =--fzf=. The code wasnt tested
with older versions though.

** Env vars

Some settings can be set with env vars instead of options. As usually,
options override the corresponding vars if both are set.

- VANILLA_BASE :: Same as =-b= / =--base=
- VANILLA_LANG :: Same as =-l= / =--lang=
- VANILLA_FZF :: =y= for =--fzf=, =n= for =--no-fzf=. Other values are
  ignored.

** Config files

Alternative to env vars, you can set the vars in =/etc/vanillarc= or
=~/.config/vanillarc= (applies last).

** Commands

If run without any args, the script just prints the usage text.

*** install

Install or try to upgrade a package and refresh its symlink in the
base dir. Internally this command is a combo of =download=, =extract=
and non-interactive =select=.

Example: =vanilla install firefox=

*** download

Download the latest version of a package into the current dir if only
an update is available and verify the signature.

Example: =vanilla download firefox=

*** extract

Extract a previously downloaded archive into the base dir.

Example: =vanilla extract firefox-140.0.2.tar.xz=

*** select

Interactively select the version for a package's symlink in the base
dir.

Example: =vanilla select firefox=

*** delete

Interactively select and delete a version of a package from the base
dir and adjust the package's symlink if needed.

Example: =vanilla delete firefox=

*** prune

Delete old versions of a package from the base dir. By default only 2
most recent versions are kept including the symlinked one. Use =-n=
option to override the default.

Use =--dry-run= flag to only print what is to be deleted.

You cant delete the only installed version with =prune=, use =delete=
for that.

Example: =vanilla prune firefox=

*** list

List installed versions for a package or all packages.

Example: =vanilla list=

*** langs

List available languages for the latest version of a package.

Example: =vanilla langs firefox=

*** desktop

Generate a desktop file for the package. By default the =Exec= and
=Icon= properties contain full pathes. With =--no-path= /
=--no-icon-path= it would be just a package name like =firefox= or
=firefox-esr=.

Example: =vanilla desktop firefox=

* FAQ

- Why not just use Mozilla stuff bundled with distro X? :: There are
  outdated systems like Ubuntu 14.04 which are still used and recieve
  some kind of support (Ubuntu [[https://ubuntu.com/security/esm][ESM]]) but the updates no longer cover
  Firefox and Thunderbird.

- But there are snaps, flatpaks :: One more option to chose
  from. Besides one might want to run Firefox under Firejail which
  does not play along with those sandboxing solutions.

- Why not use built-in upgrades :: I dont like the idea of self
  modifying software especially in case of a browser.

- Why there is no thunderbird-esr package :: Thunderbird ESR is
  discontinued since 2014. Thunderbird tracks Firefox ESR [[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Calendar][schedule]]
  instead.
